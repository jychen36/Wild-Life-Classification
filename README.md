# Wild-Life-Classification
The effectiveness of wildlife preservation relies heavily on in-depth understanding of the diversity and behavior of animals, which requires intensive manual labor of experts to correctly label the images collected. In this project, we will try to automate this process by constructing a deep learning model for wildlife classification.

Training Parameters:\
Loss function: Cross-Entropy loss\
Optimizer: Adam Optimizer\
Batch size: 64\
Learning Rate: 0.0001\
